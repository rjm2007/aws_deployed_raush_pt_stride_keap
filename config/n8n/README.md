# n8n workflows

Import these four files in order:

```text
workflows/01-lead-action-intake.workflow.json
workflows/02-lead-action-recovery.workflow.json
workflows/03-sheet-update-webhook.workflow.json
workflows/04-lead-profile-sync.workflow.json
```

Workflow 04 is separate from Action intake. It watches only staff-owned profile fields and reads the same
`RPT_N8N_INTAKE_SECRET` and `RPT_BACKEND_BASE_URL` environment values as Workflow 01. The request sends the
row's Lead ID, and the backend matches `leads.id` before updating any profile. A same-phone update stops
without writing the Sheet. A changed phone does not alter the database or cadence; it writes
`Phone number changed; needs review` to that exact Sheet row.

The complete variable, API, authentication, failure, and testing contract is in the repository root
`plan.md`.

## Exact Sheet headers

```text
Lead ID | Name | Phone Number | Email | Date Of Birth | Location | Case | Action |
Needs Review | Action Status | Cadence Day | Cadence events | Call Outcome | Message Outcome |
Email Outcome | Transcript Link | Callback At |
Action Request ID | Action Started At
```

`Action` is a staff command only. `Action Status` is a system result only. `Cadence events` says what ran and
the three outcome columns say what happened on each channel. Hide and protect the last two recovery columns.

Phone Number identifies a person in the backend, but it is not a safe Sheet row key because the same person
may be entered again. Intake first writes to the exact trigger `row_number`. After that write, intake,
recovery, and AWS status updates target the unique `Action Request ID`. This keeps an older row unchanged when
a later row restarts the same lead.

The intake workflow processes every changed row returned by one Google poll. Its validation and AWS-response
Code nodes loop over `$input.all()`; the signing step reconnects data by `Action Request ID`. Do not change
either Code node to read only `$json` while it is in `Run Once for All Items` mode, because that collapses a
multi-row poll to its first row.

## Commands and date input

Exact Action options:

```text
Start cadence
Restart cadence
Do not contact
Booked
```

Enter Date Of Birth as `DD/MM/YYYY`. The intake workflow converts it to ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` before signing and
sending it. A one-word Name is valid. The Sheet's Case column is sent as the backend `lead_type`; any
non-empty text is accepted under either name.

## n8n environment

```dotenv
RPT_BACKEND_BASE_URL=https://your-api-domain.example
RPT_N8N_INTAKE_KEY_ID=
RPT_N8N_INTAKE_SECRET=
RPT_N8N_SHEET_KEY_ID=
RPT_N8N_SHEET_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
N8N_BLOCK_ENV_ACCESS_IN_NODE=false
```

The Code nodes use Web Crypto and do not require Node's `crypto` module. If environment access is disabled in
your n8n task runner, replace each `$env` expression inside n8n with its production value before activation;
never commit those secret-bearing exports. The n8n key IDs and secrets must equal their backend counterparts,
but the intake secret and Sheet-webhook secret must be different from each other.

## Endpoints

Intake:

```text
POST {RPT_BACKEND_BASE_URL}/api/v1/integrations/n8n/lead-actions
```

Existing-row profile/phone sync:

```text
POST {RPT_BACKEND_BASE_URL}/api/v1/integrations/n8n/lead-sync
```

Create a separate Google trigger for `Name`, `Phone Number`, `Email`, `Date Of Birth`, `Location`, and `Case`.
Send rows only when Lead ID exists. A same-phone response updates only the database and stops. A changed-phone
response keeps the existing Lead ID and cadence unchanged; update only that triggering row's Action Status to
`Phone number changed; needs review`. Reuse the intake HMAC key and signing logic.

AWS status-update webhook:

```text
POST https://n8n.aibolt.ai/webhook/6c9192c3-ccbf-4530-aa31-88c4ba296d5b
```

Both directions sign `timestamp + "." + exact raw body` with HMAC-SHA256. They use separate secrets.

## Google Update-node fields

- `Write Validation Error`: match `row_number`; write Action Status and Action Started At.
- `Mark Row Processing`: match `row_number`; write Action Status, Action Request ID, and Action Started At.
- `Write Intake Result`: match Action Request ID; write Lead ID, Action Status, and recovery fields.
- `Write Recovery Result`: match Action Request ID; write Lead ID, Action Status, and recovery fields.
- `Update System Columns`: match Action Request ID; write Action Status, Needs Review, Cadence Day,
  Cadence events, Call Outcome, Message Outcome, Email Outcome, Transcript Link, and Callback At.

After import, reselect the supplied Google OAuth credential in each Google node if n8n displays a warning.
Activate the update-webhook workflow before enabling the backend Sheet worker.

## Action Status lifecycle

```text
Processing: Start cadence
  -> success: Cadence started + Lead ID
  -> temporary failure: Retrying 1/3: Start cadence
  -> temporary failure: Retrying 2/3: Start cadence
  -> third temporary failure: Error: backend unavailable after 3 attempts
  -> permanent 4xx failure: Error: <backend reason>
```

Recovery runs every five minutes and waits at least two minutes after the last attempt. It reuses the same
Action Request ID, so a lost HTTP response cannot create the cadence twice. Existing legacy `Processing:`
rows are also accepted by recovery.

The intake guard prevents its own Sheet writes from creating a loop. `Processing`, `Retrying`, `Error`, and
the completed result for the selected Action stop the row. To retry an error, staff clears Action Status.
Selecting Booked on an active row is processed once; the returned Booked status then stops retriggering.

`Restart cadence` always removes unfinished planned/skipped steps and creates a fresh run from Day 0,
including when the previous cadence was paused.
