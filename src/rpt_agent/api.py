DESCRIPTION = """
Patient outreach and live Stride booking for Rausch Physical Therapy.

**Authentication.** The three tool endpoints need the Vapi shared secret. Click
**Authorize**, paste `VAPI_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, and Try it out will send it. `Authorization:
Bearer <secret>` works too.

**Dual format.** Every endpoint accepts either the flat JSON shown here or the Vapi
tool-call envelope, so the same URL serves both Swagger and the voice agent.

**Live providers.** Stride, Vapi and Twilio are in real mode. `check-availability` is
read-only; `create-appointment` books a real appointment and queues an SMS.

Provider callbacks (Twilio and Vapi webhooks) are authenticated by request signature and
are deliberately not listed here - they cannot be exercised from this page.
