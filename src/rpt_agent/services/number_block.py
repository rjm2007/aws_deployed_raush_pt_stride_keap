"""Block and unblock a phone number from the dashboard.

A block lives on the number (suppressed_numbers), not on one lead: the worker
never dials or texts a suppressed number, whichever lead it belongs to. The
Google Sheet blocks the same way, so the dashboard switch and the Sheet's Do Not
Contact have to mean the same thing.

Unblocking is the dangerous direction. While a number is blocked its schedule
keeps ageing, so releasing it without care either fires every overdue step at
once or leaves the Sheet still saying Do Not Contact, ready to block the
patient again the next time the row is touched. Every unblock therefore picks
what happens next (continue, or start over) and tells the Sheet. There is no
"unblock and wait": a lead left on hold showed a Resume button with nothing to
resume, because the block had already cancelled its steps.
