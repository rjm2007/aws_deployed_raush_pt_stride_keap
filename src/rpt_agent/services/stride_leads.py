"""Connect imported Stride patients to our outreach leads.

A lead we are calling may book on their own (SMS link, phone, front desk). We
only learn that when Stride's next export shows the appointment. This module:

1. links a Stride patient to the lead it belongs to;
2. marks the lead booked and stops its cadence when the patient has a future,
   non-cancelled appointment;
3. flags a booked lead for staff when that booking is cancelled or deleted in
   Stride. It never puts the lead back into calls and texts.

Every step is recomputed from current table state, so a crash, a re-run or an
out-of-order file cannot leave it half done.
